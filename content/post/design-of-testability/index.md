## Introduction
Design of Testability (DoT), based on reliability testing, is a design characteristic performed during the product design phase to determine the operational status of systems and devices and to isolate internal faults. It is an important leading-edge technology for improving system reliability, maintainability, safety, and security, directly impacting fault detection rates, isolation rates, and the maintenance (testing) costs of the system.

<!--Place the notebooks that you would like to publish in a `notebooks` folder at the root of your website.

## Import the notebooks into your site

```bash
pipx install academic
academic import 'notebooks/**.ipynb' content/post/ --verbose
```

The notebooks will be published to the folder you specify above. In this case, they will be published to your `content/post/` folder.
