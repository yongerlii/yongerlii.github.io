abstract: Optimal sensor allocation can substantially reduce the life cycle maintenance
  costs of engineering systems. Considerable effort has been exerted to model the
  causal relationship between sensors and faults, but without considering the propagation
  of fault risk. In this paper, a grey relational analysis (GRA) based quantitative
  causal diagram (QCD) sensor allocation strategy is proposed that can take account
  of the influence of the propagation of fault risk. QCD is used to describe both
  the fault-sensor causal relationship and the fault-to-fault causal relationship.
  A data-driven-based GRA is applied in QCD to calculate the coefficients of the propagation
  of fault risk. To achieve an accurate relationship between faults and sensors, an
  improved quantitative analytic hierarchy process is proposed to calculate the coefficients
  between faults and sensors that is defined as sensor detectability in this paper.
  An optimal sensor allocation strategy is then developed using an improved particle
  swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm under the constraint on sensor detectability
  to minimize fault unobservability and total cost. The proposed strategy is demonstrated
  by a case study on a single-phase inverter system. Compared with two other sensor
  allocation strategies, the results show that the proposed strategy can obtain the
  lowest fault unobservability of per unit cost (âˆ’0.242) for sensor allocation under
  the propagation of fault risk.
