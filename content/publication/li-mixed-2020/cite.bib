 abstract = {Accelerated degradation testing (ADT) is used to efficiently assess the reliability and lifetime of a high reliable products under normal stress. In general, it is common in practice to build stochastic models of degradation under a single failure mechanism based on the ADT data. However, in real applications, multi-failure mechanisms may influence the degradation process. Motivated by this, a mixed stochastic process model for ADT is proposed in this paper. The mixed stochastic process combines two single-stochastic processes with weights determined by a quantitative method that establishes the relationship with accelerated stress. After the unknown parameter estimation, the proposed model under normal stress level can be obtained. The results show that the proposed model can be used for ADT modeling under multi-failure mechanisms.},
