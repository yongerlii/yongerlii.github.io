abstract: Accelerated degradation testing (ADT) is used to efficiently assess the
  reliability and lifetime of a high reliable products under normal stress. In general,
  it is common in practice to build stochastic models of degradation under a single
  failure mechanism based on the ADT data. However, in real applications, multi-failure
  mechanisms may influence the degradation process. Motivated by this, a mixed stochastic
  process model for ADT is proposed in this paper. The mixed stochastic process combines
  two single-stochastic processes with weights determined by a quantitative method
  that establishes the relationship with accelerated stress. After the unknown parameter
  estimation, the proposed model under normal stress level can be obtained. The results
  show that the proposed model can be used for ADT modeling under multi-failure mechanisms.
