abstract: In this paper, the distributed formation tracking control problem of quadrotor
  unmanned aerial vehicles is considered. Adaptive backstepping inherently accommodates
  model uncertainties and external disturbances, making it a robust choice for the
  dynamic and unpredictable environments in which unmanned aerial vehicles operate.
  This paper designs a formation flight control scheme for quadrotor unmanned aerial
  vehicles based on adaptive backstepping technology. The proposed control scheme
  is divided into two parts. For the position subsystem, a distributed robust formation
  tracking control scheme is developed to achieve formation flight of quadrotor unmanned
  aerial vehicles and track the desired flight trajectory. For the attitude subsystem,
  an adaptive disturbance rejection control scheme is proposed to achieve attitude
  stabilization during unmanned aerial vehicle flight under uncertain disturbances.
  Compared to existing results, the novelty of this paper lies in presenting a disturbance
  rejection flight control scheme for actual quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle formations,
  without the need to know the model parameters of each unmanned aerial vehicle. Finally,
  a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle swarm system is used to verify the effectiveness
  of the proposed control scheme.
