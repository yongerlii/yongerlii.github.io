 abstract = {In this paper, the problem of distributed adaptive consensus tracking control for second-order nonlinear heterogeneous multi-agent systems (MASs) with input quantization is considered. A distributed output feedback control scheme based on a K-filter is developed to suppress the influences of unknown disturbances and input quantization. In contrast to existing approaches, an additional design parameter is introduced into the controller design to ensure that the subsystem tracking error converges to an arbitrarily small residual set. Through Lyapunov stability analysis, it can be proved that the proposed control scheme can achieve distributed consensus tracking control of second-order nonlinear heterogeneous MASs. In addition, all signals in the closed-loop system are shown to be globally uniformly bounded. Finally, a practical example demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed control method.},
