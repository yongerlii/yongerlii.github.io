abstract: In this paper, the problem of distributed adaptive consensus tracking control
  for second-order nonlinear heterogeneous multi-agent systems (MASs) with input quantization
  is considered. A distributed output feedback control scheme based on a K-filter
  is developed to suppress the influences of unknown disturbances and input quantization.
  In contrast to existing approaches, an additional design parameter is introduced
  into the controller design to ensure that the subsystem tracking error converges
  to an arbitrarily small residual set. Through Lyapunov stability analysis, it can
  be proved that the proposed control scheme can achieve distributed consensus tracking
  control of second-order nonlinear heterogeneous MASs. In addition, all signals in
  the closed-loop system are shown to be globally uniformly bounded. Finally, a practical
  example demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed control method.
