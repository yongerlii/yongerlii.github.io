abstract: This paper investigates a class of nonholonomic chained systems with integral
  input-to-state stable (iISS) inverse dynamics subject to unknown virtual control
  directions and parameter uncertainty included in drift terms. First, the system
  is divided into two interconnected subsystems according to the system&rsquo;s structure.
  Second, one controller is designed using a switch strategy for state finite escape.
  Then, another controller and adaptive law are designed by combining a reduced-order
  state observer and backstepping method after input-state scaling. Finally, simulation
  results validate the feasibility of the proposed control algorithm.
