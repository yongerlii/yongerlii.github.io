 abstract = {This paper investigates a class of nonholonomic chained systems with integral input-to-state stable (iISS) inverse dynamics subject to unknown virtual control directions and parameter uncertainty included in drift terms. First, the system is divided into two interconnected subsystems according to the system&rsquo;s structure. Second, one controller is designed using a switch strategy for state finite escape. Then, another controller and adaptive law are designed by combining a reduced-order state observer and backstepping method after input-state scaling. Finally, simulation results validate the feasibility of the proposed control algorithm.},
