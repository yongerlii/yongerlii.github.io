abstract: 'Islanding detection is an important issue in distributed generations (DGs)
  systems. Therefore, anti-islanding protection is a critical concern. A novel reactive
  power variation (RPV) islanding detection method based on correlation function data
  fusion and support vector machine (CFDF-SVM) approach is presented to reduce the
  non-detection zone (NDZ) and avoid the false detection caused by pseudo islanding
  phenomenon (PIP). The feature data sets (frequency, injected reactive power, fundamental
  and third harmonics of point of common coupling (PCC) voltage and current) are acquired
  by Fourier transform and fused by CFDF approach. After that, the fused data sets
  are classified into two categories by an SVM approach: islanding and non-islanding.
  In addition, the proposed approach is based on the active intermittent RPV method
  which reduced the NDZ fundamentally. Compared with the traditional RPV method, the
  proposed method could detect islanding event accurately, and the false detection
  rate caused by PIP is significantly reduced. Then a single-phase-inverter is built
  by Simulink, the detection results have proved the effectiveness of the proposed
  method.'
