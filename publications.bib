In order to reduce the reactive power variation (RPV) which is used by the conventional active islanding detection method (IDM) and avoid the false alarm, a novel data-driven IDM combines adaptive back propagation neural network data fusion and support vector machine (ABPS) is presented by taking PIP into consideration. The feature datasets (frequency, RPV) are selected to detect the islanding event. The proposed method involves two steps: first, k-means cluster and logic operation techniques are used to process the offline data for training ABPS; second, the online testing data are classified into two categories by ABPS: islanding and non-islanding. Compared with the conventional active IDM, the proposed method could detect islanding event by using less RPV, and the false alarm caused by PIP is significantly avoided. Then, a case study of the single-phase-inverter is used to prove the proposed method is more capable of islanding detection than the conventional active IDM.},

	abstract = {Optimal sensor allocation can substantially reduce the life cycle maintenance costs of engineering systems. Considerable effort has been exerted to model the causal relationship between sensors and faults, but without considering the propagation of fault risk. In this paper, a grey relational analysis (GRA) based quantitative causal diagram (QCD) sensor allocation strategy is proposed that can take account of the influence of the propagation of fault risk. QCD is used to describe both the fault-sensor causal relationship and the fault-to-fault causal relationship. A data-driven-based GRA is applied in QCD to calculate the coefficients of the propagation of fault risk. To achieve an accurate relationship between faults and sensors, an improved quantitative analytic hierarchy process is proposed to calculate the coefficients between faults and sensors that is defined as sensor detectability in this paper. An optimal sensor allocation strategy is then developed using an improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm under the constraint on sensor detectability to minimize fault unobservability and total cost. The proposed strategy is demonstrated by a case study on a single-phase inverter system. Compared with two other sensor allocation strategies, the results show that the proposed strategy can obtain the lowest fault unobservability of per unit cost (âˆ’0.242) for sensor allocation under the propagation of fault risk.},

A distributed output feedback control scheme based on a K-filter is developed to suppress the influences of unknown disturbances and input quantization. In contrast to existing approaches, an additional design parameter is introduced into the controller design to ensure that the subsystem tracking error converges to an arbitrarily small residual set. Through Lyapunov stability analysis, it can be proved that the proposed control scheme can achieve distributed consensus tracking control of second-order nonlinear heterogeneous MASs. In addition, all signals in the closed-loop system are shown to be globally uniformly bounded. Finally, a practical example demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed control method.},

Adaptive backstepping inherently accommodates model uncertainties and external disturbances, making it a robust choice for the dynamic and unpredictable environments in which unmanned aerial vehicles operate. This paper designs a formation flight control scheme for quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles based on adaptive backstepping technology. The proposed control scheme is divided into two parts. For the position subsystem, a distributed robust formation tracking control scheme is developed to achieve formation flight of quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles and track the desired flight trajectory. For the attitude subsystem, an adaptive disturbance rejection control scheme is proposed to achieve attitude stabilization during unmanned aerial vehicle flight under uncertain disturbances. Compared to existing results, the novelty of this paper lies in presenting a disturbance rejection flight control scheme for actual quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle formations, without the need to know the model parameters of each unmanned aerial vehicle. Finally, a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle swarm system is used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

	abstract = {Islanding detection is an important issue in distributed generations (DGs) systems. Therefore, anti-islanding protection is a critical concern. A novel reactive power variation (RPV) islanding detection method based on correlation function data fusion and support vector machine (CFDF-SVM) approach is presented to reduce the non-detection zone (NDZ) and avoid the false detection caused by pseudo islanding phenomenon (PIP). The feature data sets (frequency, injected reactive power, fundamental and third harmonics of point of common coupling (PCC) voltage and current) are acquired by Fourier transform and fused by CFDF approach. After that, the fused data sets are classified into two categories by an SVM approach: islanding and non-islanding. In addition, the proposed approach is based on the active intermittent RPV method which reduced the NDZ fundamentally. Compared with the traditional RPV method, the proposed method could detect islanding event accurately, and the false detection rate caused by PIP is significantly reduced. Then a single-phase-inverter is built by Simulink, the detection results have proved the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

	abstract = {Accelerated degradation testing (ADT) is used to efficiently assess the reliability and lifetime of a high reliable products under normal stress. In general, it is common in practice to build stochastic models of degradation under a single failure mechanism based on the ADT data. However, in real applications, multi-failure mechanisms may influence the degradation process. Motivated by this, a mixed stochastic process model for ADT is proposed in this paper. The mixed stochastic process combines two single-stochastic processes with weights determined by a quantitative method that establishes the relationship with accelerated stress. After the unknown parameter estimation, the proposed model under normal stress level can be obtained. The results show that the proposed model can be used for ADT modeling under multi-failure mechanisms.},
